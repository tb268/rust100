# Rust 100 Days Challenge 🦀

A 100-day journey to learn Rust programming language.

## Progress (3/100)

| Day | Project | Topic | What I Learned |
|-----|---------|-------|----------------|
| 001 | [hello-rust](./001/hello-rust) | Hello World | Basic syntax, cargo usage |
| 002 | [number](./002/number) | Number operations | Variables, types, stdin |
| 003 | [fizzbuzz](./fizzbuzz_003) | FizzBuzz | Conditionals, loops |

## Goals
- Master Rust fundamentals
- Commit daily
- Build practical projects

## Environment
- Rust: stable
- OS: macOS

## AI Usage Policy

AI tools are used **only** for:
- Hints and suggestions (like Copilot)
- Environment setup and configuration
- Documentation and README writing

**All core code is written by hand without AI assistance.** This is a personal learning challenge to truly understand Rust fundamentals.

## How to Run

Navigate to each project directory and run:

```bash
cd 001/hello-rust
cargo run
```
